# Wallpaper-Auto-Changer
Auto change the wallpaper by iterating through images in a chosen directory with "feh" image viewer. You must have feh installed.
```shell
# Make it executable
chmod +x change.sh
# Starting the program for current session
./change.sh
```
Don't be shy to edit the file to choose your wallpapers directory, sleep time in seconds or feh options.
